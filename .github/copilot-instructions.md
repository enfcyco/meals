# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Meals Repository

## Project Purpose
This repository is designed to store and manage lists of meals that we like. The long-term goal is to create an automated meal rotation system.

## Current Structure
- `meals.txt`: A simple text file containing a list of favorite meals, one per line

## Future Goals
- Implement meal rotation functionality
- Auto-generate meal plans
- Possibly add categorization (e.g., Italian, Mexican, American)
- Add preparation time, ingredients, or difficulty ratings

## Guidelines for Assistance
- Keep the meal list simple and easy to read
- When adding features, maintain backward compatibility with the simple text format
- Focus on practical, easy-to-use solutions
- Consider adding meal categories or tags in the future
